Modified experiment.py for distributed execution on remote VMs.

We now run chordify nodes on remote machines via ssh.
The available VMs are accessed using:
  team_32-vm1, team_32-vm2, team_32-vm3, team_32-vm4, team_32-vm5, team_32-vm6

Nodes (10 in total) are distributed roundâ€‘robin over these hosts.
