connect_experiment1.py

This script runs (via SSH) the distributed experiment.
For each experiment configuration (replication factor k and consistency policy),
it connects to the six VMs (team_32-vm1 â€¦ team_32-vm6) in a round-robin fashion
to start 10 chord nodes. The bootstrap node (node 0) gets a flag so that it will
execute "join -b {ip} {port}", while the other nodes simply execute "join".
Once all nodes are started, each instance of run_experiment1.py will perform its insert operations.
